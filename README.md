## Hi there, I'm Reza Jahanimir 👋
A former medical student turned software developer in training. I started my career studying General Medicine at Kharkiv National University (2017–Feb 2022), but the ongoing war shifted my path. Today I'm a trainee at Code Your Future in the United Kingdom, learning full‑stack development with Python, Django, Express, JavaScript, HTML & CSS. I build accessible websites, experiment with APIs and love solving real problems with code.

⚡ About Me
🧠 Career pivot: I’m channeling the analytical mindset from my medicine studies into coding. Building software has become my new way of helping people.

🎓 Code Your Future trainee: Working through modules on data flows, data structures and full‑stack projects. These repositories are mostly assignments and practice projects from the bootcamp.

🛠 Hands‑on projects: Check out some of the things I’m working on below—everything from a TV‑show episode explorer to a coursework planner.

🖥 Hardware tinkerer: I’ve assembled and maintained 10+ custom PCs for family and friends and love troubleshooting hardware issues.

📍 Based in London, UK.

🔧 Tech Stack
Languages: Python, JavaScript

Frameworks & Libraries: Django, Express

Tools: Git & GitHub, SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL), HTML & CSS

Others: Comfortable with Linux, command‑line tools and Microsoft Office
